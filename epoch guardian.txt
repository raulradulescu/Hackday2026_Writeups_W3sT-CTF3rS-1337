Here is the step-by-step explanation of how I solved the Epoch Guardian CTF:

Initial Reconnaissance,
The challenge presented a chatbot ("Guardian of Époch") that required a "Sigil of Destiny" to proceed. The bot provided hints for the Sigil's format: SIGIL:<FRAG_A>-<FRAG_B>-<FRAG_C>.

Finding Fragment A (a9f3c1e8b2d4),
Hint: The bot simply listed - FRAG_A..
Discovery: I inspected the HTML source code of the main page. Hidden deep within a large block of whitespace comments near the bottom of the source, I found the definition: FRAG_A = "a9f3c1e8b2d4".
Finding Fragment C (c4b7aa10d92f),
Hint: The bot stated - FRAG_C is attached to the system heartbeat.
Discovery: The website had a "Heartbeat" link pointing to /healthz. I inspected the HTTP headers of the response from that endpoint. The fragment was hidden in a custom header:
x-epoch-heartbeat: c4b7aa10d92f
Finding Fragment B (5e7d0c19fa33),
Hint: The bot's message had a suspicious space in - FRAG_B ., and the UI contained a link labeled "Crawler Rules txt" that oddly pointed back to the homepage (/) instead of a text file.
Discovery: I hypothesized that "Crawler Rules" referred to a standard file like robots.txt. While robots.txt was generic, I checked for other similar files. A request to /rules.txt (a common variation) returned valid text containing the fragment:
PROPHETIC_FRAGMENT_B: 5e7d0c19fa33,
Assembling the Sigil & Getting the Flag,
I combined the three fragments into the required format: SIGIL:a9f3c1e8b2d4-5e7d0c19fa33-c4b7aa10d92f

Sending this message to the bot successfully unlocked the system and revealed the flag: HACKDAY{9ed0a607d4f2e0b9b5ee428fd925280b9f63bed81e0b90c1f135ca41c69b774a}
